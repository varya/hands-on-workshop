import Layout from "@templates/layout"

export default Layout
export const meta = { title: "Product update" }



Now the library is ready, and you can change your legacy product
code with the new fancy components, from the library you have just
released.

**At this stage, your final goal is to replace the product legacy code
with the components**.

Keep product server running when making the changes.

```
yarn product
```

## Updating the product


Go to package.json of your product (`product/package.json`) and change the
version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "design-system": "0.1.0", 
+   "design-system": "0.2.0",
    ...
  }

```

Change the product files to use new components and
see them in action as you development server is running.
