As a developer, you are working on **version 1** of your library. You
already have a product and it is functioning (kind of). But the interface
there is not componentized. Let's fix it.

By this time, you should already have a list of components to implement, aligned with
your team. **At this step, your final goal is to create a set of components for your
future product**. Focus on the Storybook, don't change the product yet.
However, you can copy-paste the styles from the product.

## Workflow

This is a large task, that we are going to work on also on the second day. We split it
to the following parts:

1. Update design tokens
1. Process the tokens with Style Dictionary
1. Display design tokens in Storybook
1. Update the components with tokens
1. Write new components
1. Visual regression tests


## 1. Updating design tokens

If you want to sync with the design library, build Figma tokens.
You will use in components and product pages.
The tokens are exported from Figma in one click with
[Design Tokens plugin](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens). Once
you got `design-tokens.json` file from your designer, put it to
`design-system/tokens/design-tokens.json`.

### Under the tokens' hood

The exported is not very convenient for development, so we process
it with the help of [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).
You can see the result in `design-system/src/tokens/dist/`. These are the
the files that will be imported into the components. You don't have to change
anything there, but it is good to know how
these things work.


## 2. Process the tokens with Style Dictionary

You can see in `design-system/src/tokens/dist/` how *color* and *typography*
tokens are displayed. But as you noticed, the `design-tokens.json` file has much
more information. For example, space tokens. Before you use them in the library,
you need a custom processing via Style Dictionary.

**Let's write a custom processing for spacing tokens.**


## 3. Display design tokens in Storybook

Now you have spacing tokens as variables. The next step is to make them visible
in Storybook. Look at the stories for colors and typography as an example.

**Let's display spacing tokens.**


## 4. Update the components with tokens

In the repository, you have some components. But only the color tokens are used
in their code. The spacing values are hard-coded.

**Let's bring tokens into the code.**


## 5. Writing new components

Quickly add component template files:

```
yarn add-component <ComponentName>
```

For example, if you run `yarn add-component Avatar`, a new folder with two new files will be created at `design-system/src/components`:

- Avatar/
  - index.js
  - Avatar.stories.mdx

**Note**. When you add the component, it gets re-exported in the library index file,
which is `design-system/src/index.js`. If you want to rename or remove a component,
don't forget also to change there.

### What do I code?
Check [https://component.gallery/](https://component.gallery/) to get ideas on how to fill your
component with code.

## 6. Visual regression tests

**Note**. *Creevey requires Docker to be installed.*

To keep the system consistent, you should always provide visual references for your
components. This will make automatic testing work smoothly. This is how
you can do it:

1. Run the testing UI with `yarn test:creevey:ui`
2. Run the tests and examine the results
  1. Noticed the inconcistency? Fix and run the tests again.
  2. There is a change but you were expecting it? Approve.

If you created a new component, or visualy changed the existing one, it
will always go with the change of their visual references. Notice the changes
files in `design-system/tests/referenceImages`, add them and commit. It is
a good habit to include your visual references in your pull request. And it
ensures the tests automation.
