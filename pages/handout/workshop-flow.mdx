## Zoom spaces

In this workshop, you are working in cross-functional teams (designers and developers).
We use Zoom's **Main session** for introduction and presentations that are adressed to
both parties. For design- and development- related instructions we use **Designers' Room**
and **Developers' Room**. For in-team communication, you can use your team's room (named as
**Team 1**, **Team 2**, etc.)

You can join another room freely any time, this way:

1. Find a list of breakout rooms
  ![](/zoom-breakout-rooms.png)
1. Use the "Join" button near the room's name. It might be visible on hover.
  ![](/zoom-breakout-rooms2.png)

If you want to leave the room, you press blue button at the bottom right of the Zoom screen.
Don't leave the meeting. If you accedentally left the meeting, join again. :-)

Host might invite you to a certain room. In this case you will see a popup about it.

## Slack channels

Use **GoRight Slack** to exchange text messages. If you are not there yet, [join by this

In the slack, there is **#hands-on-workshop##** channel for our everyone's use and teams' channels
as **#team1**, **#team2s**, etc. All the channels are public, join the relevant team channel yourself.
