import Layout from "@templates/layout"

export default Layout
export const meta = { title: "Setting up the Project" }


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following apps installed on your machine:

- Node.js 12+
- Yarn


## Getting your team's repository

Chose who of your team will host the repository in their GitHub account. This person
should make a copy of the repository from a template following the instructions below and
give access to it to the other team members.

First of all you need to grab a template, which we prepared for you - navigate to
[Project repo](https://github.com/goright-io/hands-on-design-system) and press the
green button "Use this template". Make sure you choose a **publc** reposiitory type.

In your repository, go to *Settings -> Manage access* and invite your team members
as collaborators.


## Setting up for automatic deployment

We are taking advantage of GitHub Action and deploy design system when changes are pushed.
But to make it working, you need a bit of setup.

### 1. Change version
You need to change version in order to run automatic deploy. Let's do it for the first run.
You can manually change version on `./design-system/package.json`. Set it to `0.1.1`, commit
and push.

### 2. Wait for the first build

Go to *Actions* tab in your GitHub repo and wait for the first build.

### 3. Define the deployment branch

 Make sure your working repository is public, and the deployment branch is set to "gh-pages".
 For that, go to **Settings -> Pages** and choose the `gh-pages` branch in the **Source**
 select.

 You should be able to see the design system deployed at `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/design-system/"`.


## On your computers

Now, each of you can proceed with cloning the repository to your local machine.

Then install dependencies: 

```
yarn
```

## Project structure overview

The working repository consists of three [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), which can be used independently. Here is the visual representation:

For the deeper information about structure of each workspace please refer to README, located at the root of repository.


## Run component library

To start your library in development mode, run:

```
yarn design-system
```

This command will start storybook server at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006)
The storybook already contains some basic pages - Typography and Color Palette, as well as few components.


## Run the product

To see the final product, run the following command:

```
yarn product
```

You can keep both library's and product's servers running in parallel. Or you can
yet stay with the library only.
