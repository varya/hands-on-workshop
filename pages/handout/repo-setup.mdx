## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following apps installed on your machine:

- Node.js 12+
- Yarn

## Getting your team's repository

Chose who of your team will host the repository in their GitHub account. This person
should make a copy of the repository from a template following the instructions below and
give access to it to the other team members.

First of all you need to grab a template, which we prepared for you - navigate to
[Project repo](https://github.com/goright-io/hands-on-design-system) and press the
green button "Use this template". Make sure you choose a **publc** reposiitory type.

In your repository, go to *Settings -> Manage access* and invite your team members
as collaborators.


## On your computers

Now, each of you can proceed with cloning the repository to your local machine.

Then install dependencies: 

```
yarn
```

## Project structure overview

The working repository consists of three [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), which can be used independently. Here is the visual representation:

For the deeper information about structure of each workspace please refer to README, located at the root of repository.


## Run component library

To start your library in development mode, run:

```
yarn design-system
```

This command will start storybook server at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006)
The storybook already contains some basic pages - Typography and Color Palette, as well as few components.


## Run the product

To see the final product, run the following command:

```
yarn product
```

You can keep both library's and product's servers running in parallel. Or you can
yet stay with the library only.
