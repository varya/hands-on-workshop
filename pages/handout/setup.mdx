import Layout from "../../templates/layout"

export default Layout
export const meta = { title: "Setting up the project" }


## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following are installed on your machine:

- Node.js 12+
- Yarn
- Docker (optional, if you want to run the tests)

## Getting your own copy of the repository.

First of all you need to grab a template, which we prepared for you - navigate to [Project template](https://github.com/bridge-design/hands-on-workshop) and press green button "Use this template". Go on with setting up a local copy on your machine. Now you have your own copy of working repository.

Then install dependencies: 

```
yarn install
```

## Project structure overview.

The working repository consists of three [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), which can be used independently. Here is the visual representation:

For the deeper information about structure of each workspace please refer to README, located at the root of repository.


## Building Figma tokens

First step is to build Figma tokens, which you will use in components and product pages. the tokens are exported from Figma in one click with [Design Tokens plugin](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens), but the default export file is not very convenient for development. The purpose of _Tokens workspace_ is simply to transform exported JSON into JS object of a convenient shape.

Build tokens once at the beginning, and every time you reexport it from Figma: 

```
yarn build:tokens
```


## Working with component library.

To start your library in development mode, run:

```
yarn design-system
```

You also can use `yarn start` alias.

This command will start storybook server at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006)
The storybook already contains some basic pages - Typography and Color Palette, as well as two components - icon and Button.


## Developing a product

Run the following command to start product development server:

```
yarn product
```

To create production build, run:

```
yarn build
```
