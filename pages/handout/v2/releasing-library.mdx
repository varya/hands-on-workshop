All the components are coded? Before you bring them to the product,
let's reelease the library.

### Release the library

When the tokens are updated, all the changes are commited,
you can release your library:


```
yarn design-system:version
```
You will be prompted to type a version.
Alongside with incrementing the version, this command builds the library and
commits the result to the repository. If you want to check beforehand that the
build goes normally, run `yarn design-system:build`.

**Now you can use the new library version in the product.**

### Additional information

When releasing the library, you can run the command with one of
the flags: `--patch`, `--minor`, `--major`. They will fill the coresponding
version number accordingly.


### Why we are keeping dist in the repo?

When we are building the library, its minified prduction-ready version
is created in  `design-system/dist` folder.
Normally, such a folder would not be a part of your repository. You would serve it as an
npm package. But in the workshop, we keep it simple: you sync with your other
team members by commiting the compiled files into the reposiitory.
